What users I expect to get:

General Public:
-> Won't dig too much into the information.
-> Add eye candy UI and maybe some colored maps to impress them.


Historians and Researchers:
-> Won't explicitly reference my map because I'm not certified.
-> Add references for the data so that they can reference that instead and maybe correct me if I misinterpreted something or just made a mistake.
-> Add search bar that lists all places that have been referenced with the given name before the selected year.
-> Add clickable place icons that list all mentions of a place before the selected year and the sources for those (maybe even links to the documents if available).
-> Add special table for golden bull.
-> Make it so that you can select the mentions from a specific ruler or within a timeframe.
-> Add numbers to every place representing the number of mentions.
